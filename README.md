## Made using React, Go, MySQL

### Libraries Used
* Frontend
  * React

* Backend
  * [Chi](github.com/go-chi/chi/v5), which is a very fast router
  * [JWT](github.com/golang-jwt/jwt), which is used to authorize Users
  * [Bcrypt](golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt), which is used to save passwords securely
  * I have used raw-sql, instead of any ORM, to practice better
